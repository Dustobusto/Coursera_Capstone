A business wants to set up a new bicycle shop in Portland. They don't want it to be near too many other bicycle shops, but they also are afraid of what a Cascadian Fault 9.0 earthquake could do to the business when it strikes. A study has been launched to map out the Portland Neighborhoods with the highest levels of building liquefaction, as well as the highest concentration of bicycle shops. 

Data has been retrieved from the PortlandMaps - Open Data project, as well as accessed via Foursquare API.
