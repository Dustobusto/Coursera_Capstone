A business wants to set up a new bicycle shop in Portland. They don't want it to be near too many other bicycle shops, but they also are afraid of what a Cascadian Fault 9.0 earthquake could do to the business when it strikes. A study has been commissioned to map out the Portland Neighborhoods with the highest levels of building liquefaction, as well as the highest concentration of bicycle shops. This will be mapped out on a choropleth map. Areas of "Very High" liquefaction will be avoided at all costs. Those remaining areas will be examined for frequency of bicyle shops and the lowest frequency will be selected. 

Data has been retrieved from the PortlandMaps - Open Data project (https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets), as well as accessed via Foursquare API. The data will encompass neighborhood zones for Portland-metro areas. Liquefaction data in the form of a comma delimited file will be superimposed on top of this data. Latitude and Longitudes will be cross-referenced with the meta data of the GeoJSON zone data to cluster buildings into liquefaction zones. Foursquare data will link venues to the buildings or surrounding areas, allowing the business to see which bicycle shops currently operate in which liquefaction zones.
